    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var toWordf = require( '@stdlib/number-float32-base-to-word' );
```

#### toWordf( x )

Returns an unsigned 32-bit `integer` corresponding to the [IEEE 754][ieee754] binary representation of a [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754].

```javascript
var float64ToFloat32 = require( '@stdlib/number-float64-base-to-float32' );

var f32 = float64ToFloat32( 1.337 );
// returns 1.3370000123977661

var w = toWordf( f32 ); // => 0 01111111 01010110010001011010001
// returns 1068180177

### Usage

```c
#include "stdlib/number/float32/base/to_word.h"
```

#### stdlib_base_float32_to_word( x, \*word )

Converts a [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754] to an unsigned 32-bit integer corresponding to the number's [IEEE 754][ieee754] binary representation.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

uint32_t word;
stdlib_base_float32_to_word( 3.14f, &word );
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: `[in] float` input value.
-   **word**: `[out] uint32_t*` destination.

```c
void stdlib_base_float32_to_word( const float x, uint32_t *word );
```

#### stdlib_base_float32_word_t

An opaque type definition for a union for converting between a [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754] and an unsigned 32-bit integer.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

stdlib_base_float32_word_t w;

// Assign a single-precision floating-point number:
w.value = 3.14f;

// Retrieve the word:
uint32_t word = w.word;
```

The union has the following members:

-   **value**: `float` [single-precision floating-point number][ieee754].
-   **word**: `uint32_t` word.
