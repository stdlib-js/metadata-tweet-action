    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var accessors = require( '@stdlib/array-base-accessors' );
```

#### accessors( x )

Returns element accessors for a provided array-like object.

```javascript
var obj = accessors( [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ] );
// returns {...}

var bool = obj.accessorProtocol;
// returns false

var fcns = obj.accessors;
// returns [ <Function>, <Function> ]
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The returned object has the following properties:

    -   **accessorProtocol**: `boolean` indicating whether the provided array-like object supports the get/set protocol (i.e., uses accessors for getting and setting elements).
    -   **accessors**: a two-element array whose first element is an accessor for retrieving an array element (i.e., a getter) and whose second element is an accessor for setting an array element (i.e., a setter).

-   The getter accessor accepts two arguments:

    -   **arr**: array-like object.
    -   **idx**: element index.

-   The setter accessor accepts three arguments:

    -   **arr**: array-like object.
    -   **idx**: element index.
    -   **value**: value to set.

-   The intent of this function is to provide a minimal abstraction over how elements are accessed when operating on indexed (i.e., array-like objects supporting element accesss via integer indices using bracket `[]` syntax) and accessor (i.e., array-like objects supporting the get/set protocol in which explicit `get` and `set` methods are used for element access) array-like objects.

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var Complex64Array = require( '@stdlib/array-complex64' );
var zeroTo = require( '@stdlib/array-base-zero-to' );
var accessors = require( '@stdlib/array-base-accessors' );

// Create an array:
var x = new Complex64Array( zeroTo( 10 ) );

// Get accessor functions for retrieving array elements:
var obj = accessors( x );
// returns {...}

// Check whether the array supports the accessor protocol:
var bool = obj.accessorProtocol;
// returns true

console.log( 'Accessor protocol: %s', bool );

// Retrieve an array element:
var v = obj.accessors[ 0 ]( x, 1 );
// returns <Complex64>

console.log( 'x[1] = %s', v.toString() );
