    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

> Split a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] into a higher order word and a lower order word.

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/number-float64-base-to-words
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var toWords = require( '@stdlib/number-float64-base-to-words' );
```

#### toWords( x )

Splits a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] into a higher order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`) and a lower order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`).

```javascript
var w = toWords( 3.14e201 );
// returns [ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]
```

By default, the function returns an `array` containing two elements: a higher order word and a lower order word. The lower order word contains the less significant bits, while the higher order word contains the more significant bits and includes the exponent and sign.

```javascript
var w = toWords( 3.14e201 );
// returns [ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]

var high = w[ 0 ];
// returns 1774486211

var low = w[ 1 ];
// returns 2479577218
```

#### toWords.assign( x, out, stride, offset )

Splits a [double-precision floating-point number][ieee754] into a higher order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`) and a lower order word (unsigned 32-bit `integer`) and assigns results to a provided output array.

```javascript
var Uint32Array = require( '@stdlib/array-uint32' );

var out = new Uint32Array( 2 );

var w = toWords.assign( 3.14e201, out, 1, 0 );
// returns <Uint32Array>[ 1774486211, 2479577218 ]

var bool = ( w === out );
// returns true
```

var pow = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-pow' );

var frac;
var exp;
var w;
var x;
var i;

// Generate random numbers and split into words...
for ( i = 0; i < 100; i++ ) {
    frac = randu() * 10.0;
    exp = -floor( randu()*324.0 );
    x = frac * pow( 10.0, exp );
    w = toWords( x );
    console.log( 'x: %d. higher: %d. lower: %d.', x, w[ 0 ], w[ 1 ] );

### Usage

```c
#include "stdlib/number/float64/base/to_words.h"
```

#### stdlib_base_float64_to_words( x, \*high, \*low )

Splits a double-precision floating-point number into a higher order word and a lower order word.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

uint32_t high;
uint32_t low;

stdlib_base_float64_to_words( 3.14, &high, &low );
```

The function accepts the following arguments:

-   **x**: `[in] double` input value.
-   **high**: `[out] uint32_t*` destination for higher order word.
-   **low**: `[out] uint32_t*` destination for lower order word.

```c
void stdlib_base_float64_to_words( const double x, uint32_t *high, uint32_t *low );
```

#### stdlib_base_float64_words_t

An opaque type definition for a union for converting between a double-precision floating-point number and two unsigned 32-bit integers.

```c
#include <stdint.h>

stdlib_base_float64_words_t w;

// Assign a double-precision floating-point number:
w.value = 3.14;

// Extract the high and low words:
uint32_t high = w.words.high;
uint32_t low = w.words.low;
```

The union has the following members:

-   **value**: `double` double-precision floating-point number.

-   **words**: `struct` struct having the following members:

    -   **high**: `uint32_t` higher order word.
    -   **low**: `uint32_t` lower order word.
