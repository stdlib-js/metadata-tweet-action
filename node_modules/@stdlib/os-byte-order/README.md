    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Byte Order

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Platform [byte order][endianness].

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/os-byte-order
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var BYTE_ORDER = require( '@stdlib/os-byte-order' );
```

#### BYTE_ORDER

Platform byte order.

```javascript
console.log( BYTE_ORDER );
// => <string>
```

</section>

<!-- /.usage -->

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   The following values are possible:

    -   `'little-endian'`
    -   `'big-endian'`
    -   `'mixed-endian'` (also known as "middle-endian")
    -   `'unknown'`

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var BYTE_ORDER = require( '@stdlib/os-byte-order' );

if ( BYTE_ORDER === 'little-endian' ) {
    console.log( 'Least significant byte comes first...' );
} else if ( BYTE_ORDER === 'big-endian' ) {
    console.log( 'Most significant byte comes first...' );
} else {
    console.log( 'This is uncommon...' );
}

### Usage

```c
#include "stdlib/os/byte_order.h"
```

#### STDLIB_OS_ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN

Macro for an arbitrary constant indicating little-endian order.

```c
#if defined(STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER) && STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER == STDLIB_OS_ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN

// Do something for little-endian...

#endif
```

If compiled on an unrecognized/unsupported platform, the macro is **not** defined.

#### STDLIB_OS_ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN

Macro for an arbitrary constant indicating big-endian order.

```c
#if defined(STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER) && STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER == STDLIB_OS_ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN

// Do something for big-endian...

#endif
```

If compiled on an unrecognized/unsupported platform, the macro is **not** defined.

#### STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER

Macro which equals either `STDLIB_OS_ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN` or `STDLIB_OS_ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN` (or host defined) depending on the resolved platform byte order.

```c
#if defined(STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER)

#if STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER == STDLIB_OS_ORDER_LITTLE_ENDIAN

// Do something for little-endian...

#elif STDLIB_OS_BYTE_ORDER == STDLIB_OS_ORDER_BIG_ENDIAN

// Do something for big-endian...

#endif

#endif
```

If compiled on an unrecognized/unsupported platform, the macro is **not** defined.
