    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

# Cosine

[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url] [![Build Status][test-image]][test-url] [![Coverage Status][coverage-image]][coverage-url] <!-- [![dependencies][dependencies-image]][dependencies-url] -->

> Compute the [cosine][cosine] of a number.

<section class="installation">

## Installation

```bash
npm install @stdlib/math-base-special-cos
```

</section>

<section class="usage">

## Usage

```javascript
var cos = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-cos' );
```

#### cos( x )

Computes the [cosine][cosine] of a `number` (in radians).

```javascript
var v = cos( 0.0 );
// returns 1.0

v = cos( 3.141592653589793/4.0 );
// returns ~0.707

v = cos( -3.141592653589793/6.0 );
// returns ~0.866

v = cos( NaN );
// returns NaN
```

<section class="examples">

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var linspace = require( '@stdlib/array-base-linspace' );
var TWO_PI = require( '@stdlib/constants-float64-two-pi' );
var cos = require( '@stdlib/math-base-special-cos' );

var x = linspace( 0.0, TWO_PI, 100 );

var i;
for ( i = 0; i < x.length; i++ ) {
    console.log( cos( x[ i ] ) );
}
