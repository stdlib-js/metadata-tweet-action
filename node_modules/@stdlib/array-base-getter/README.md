    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Installation

## Usage

```javascript
var getter = require( '@stdlib/array-base-getter' );
```

#### getter( dtype )

Returns an accessor function for retrieving an element from an indexed array-like object.

```javascript
var arr = [ 1, 2, 3, 4 ];

var get = getter( 'generic' );
var v = get( arr, 2 );
// returns 3
```

The returned accessor function accepts the following arguments:

-   **arr**: input array.
-   **idx**: element index.

## Notes

-   If provided an unsupported [`dtype`][@stdlib/array/dtypes], the function returns a default accessor function for accessing elements from any indexed array-like object; otherwise, the function returns an accessor function which should **only** be provided an array instance corresponding to `dtype` (e.g., if `dtype` is `'float64'`, the returned accessor function should only be provided instances of `Float64Array`).
-   Accessor functions do **not** verify that provided input arrays are array instances corresponding to `dtype`, as doing so would introduce performance overhead. If array instances corresponding to other data types are provided to an accessor function, JavaScript runtimes will consider the function polymorphic, potentially triggering de-optimization. In order to ensure maximum performance, **always** ensure that an accessor function is monomorphic.
-   Accessor functions do **not** perform bounds checking.
-   An _indexed_ array-like object is a data structure in which one retrieves elements via integer indices using bracket `[]` notation (e.g., `Float64Array`, `Int32Array`, `Array`, etc). This is in contrast to an _accessor_ array-like object in which one retrieves elements using `get` and `set` methods (e.g., `Complex64Array` and `Complex128Array`).

## Examples

<!-- eslint no-undef: "error" -->

```javascript
var filled = require( '@stdlib/array-filled' );
var dtype = require( '@stdlib/array-dtype' );
var getter = require( '@stdlib/array-base-getter' );

var arr = filled( 1.0, 10, 'float64' );
var v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 1.0

arr = filled( 2.0, 10, 'float32' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 2.0

arr = filled( 3, 10, 'int32' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 3

arr = filled( 4, 10, 'int16' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 4

arr = filled( 5, 10, 'int8' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 5

arr = filled( 6, 10, 'uint32' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 6

arr = filled( 7, 10, 'uint16' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 7

arr = filled( 8, 10, 'uint8' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 8

arr = filled( 9, 10, 'uint8c' );
v = getter( dtype( arr ) )( arr, 2 );
// returns 9
