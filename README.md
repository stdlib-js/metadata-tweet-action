# Metadata Tweet Action

> A GitHub action for automatically sending tweets based on commit metadata.

## Example Workflow

# Workflow name:
name: Test GitHub Action

# Workflow triggers:

  push:

# Workflow jobs:
jobs:
  test:
    # Define the type of virtual host machine on which to run the job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Define the sequence of job steps...
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install
      - name: Extract metadata
        id: extract-metadata
        uses: stdlib-js/commit-metadata-action@v2
      - name: Process metadata and send tweets
        uses: stdlib-js/metadata-tweet-action@v2
        with:
          metadata: ${{ steps.extract-metadata.outputs.metadata }}
          TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY }}
          TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET }}
          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
          TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET: ${{ secrets.TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET }}
```

## Inputs

-   `metadata`: *(required)* metadata object array as generated by the [commit-metadata-action][commit-metadata-action].

-   `types`: *(optional)* comma-separated list of types for which to generate tweets. Default: `'bugfix, feature, release'`.

-   `authors`: *(optional)* file path to a JSON file containing a mapping from GitHub user names to Twitter handles.

    ```json
    {
        "kgryte": "kgryte",
        "Planeshifter": "burckhap"
    }
    ```

    Default: `'./authors.json'`.

-   `rules`: *(optional)* file path to a JSON file containing the rules for generating tweets for each type in `types`. For each type, the value should be an object whose keys are regular expression strings and whose values are corresponding replacement strings for each type.

    ```json
    {
	    "bugfix": {},
	    "feature": {
		    "/^[\\s\\S]*?adds? support ([\\s\\S]+)$/i": ":robot_face: [stdlib-bot]: Feature announcement! We've added support $1! Thanks, <author>! <url> #javascript #nodejs"
	    },
	    "release": {}
    }
    ```
    
    If a replacement string contains one or more placeholders demarcated by `< >`, the action replaces the placeholders with corresponding data from the `metadata` object. The `<author>` field is special, as the `username` subfield of the `author` metadata object is used to map to a Twitter handle. In the absence of a GitHub username to Twitter handle mapping, the action replaces the `<author>` placeholder with the GitHub author's name. 

    If the value assigned to a regular expression string is an array, then the action samples one of the replacement strings from the list of replacement strings (**note**: this is useful when wanting to add variety to generated tweets).

    ```json
    {
	    "bugfix": {},
	    "feature": {
		    "/^[\\s\\S]*?adds? support ([\\s\\S]+)$/i": [
			    ":robot_face: [stdlib-bot]: Feature announcement! We've added support $1! Thanks, <author>! <url> #javascript #nodejs",
			    ":robot_face: [stdlib-bot]: New feature! <author> added support $1! <url> #javascript #nodejs"
		    ]
	    },
	    "release": {}
    }
    ```

    Default: `'./rules.json'`.

-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`: *(required)* the consumer key for the Twitter application.

-   `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`: *(required)* the consumer secret for the Twitter application.

-   `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN`: *(required)* the access token for the Twitter application.

-   `TWITTER_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: *(required)* the access token secret for the Twitter application.
